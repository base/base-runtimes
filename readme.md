## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save base-runtimes
```

This plugin is a basic wrapper for [composer-runtimes](https://github.com/doowb/composer-runtimes) and [composer](https://github.com/doowb/composer), see those libraries to learn more about available features and options, or to report issues related to runtimes colors or formatting.

## Usage

```js
var runtimes = require('base-runtimes');
var task = require('base-tasks');
var Base = require('base');
var app = new Base();

// register plugins
app.use(task());
app.use(runtimes());

app.task('default', function(cb) {
  cb();
});

// run the `default` task
app.build(function(err) {
  if (err) throw err;
});
```

With `runtimes` registed, you should see something like the following when `.build` is called:
